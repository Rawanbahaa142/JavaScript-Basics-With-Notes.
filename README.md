üìù JavaScript Code Summary: Basics and CRUD Bank System

This document summarizes a JavaScript program covering loops, functions, arrays, objects, and a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) bank system using localStorage. The code is organized with detailed comments and emoji icons for clarity, making it an excellent study reference for GitHub.

üöÄ Overview

The code demonstrates:

Loops: for, while, do-while, and array iteration methods (forEach, find, filter).

Functions: Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and default parameters.

Arrays: Creation, manipulation (push, pop, splice, etc.), and array methods.

Objects: Object literals, methods, and arrays of objects.

CRUD Bank System: A simple system to manage user data (name, ID, balance) with localStorage.

üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure

The program is divided into sections:

Loops: Examples of for, while, and do-while loops with continue and break.

Functions: Different function types and parameter handling.

Arrays: Array creation, manipulation, and methods (push, pop, splice, forEach, find, filter).

Objects: Object properties, methods, and arrays of objects.



CRUD Bank System: Functions to add, edit, delete, and display users, stored in localStorage.
